## Hi, I am Abir!

Hello, I am Abir! I am a Computer Science major at DePaul University with an Artificial Intelligence concentration. I am always eager to learn new skills, and I am currently sharpening my skills in Python and doing mini projects along the way.

Besides Python, I am also eager to learn full stack web development, as I believe having an idea of both front end and back end can make my projects come to life and provide me with invaluable skills for the future.

Other than programming, you will often find me nerding out in economics. Economics helps me think about the world in a structured way, and I particularly enjoy learning about macroeconomic policies and their effect on different economic agents.

I have experience working with large groups of people through my organization, Desire Bangladesh. Managing teams and planning projects is something that I am proficient in.

If you want to collaborate on projects or discuss any of the hobbies mentioned above, please feel free to connect. I always reply to emails as quickly as possible.
