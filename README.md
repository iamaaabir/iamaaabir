## About Me

Hello, I’m Abir! I am a Computer Science major at DePaul University. 

At the moment, I am focused on learning backend development, including concepts such as APIs, databases, and how different parts of a system interact behind the scenes. I am taking a fundamentals-first approach and aiming to develop solid software engineering habits early on.

Other than programming, you will often find me nerding out in economics. Economics helps me think about the world in a structured way, and I particularly enjoy learning about macroeconomic policies and their effect on different economic agents.

I have experience working with large groups of people through my organization, Desire Bangladesh. Managing teams and planning projects is something that I am proficient in.

If you want to collaborate on projects or discuss any of the hobbies mentioned above, please feel free to connect. I always reply to emails as quickly as possible.
